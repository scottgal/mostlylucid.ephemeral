# Services (DI) Integration

This document describes how to register and use the Ephemeral coordinators and attribute runners with
Microsoft.Extensions.DependencyInjection (IServiceCollection).

## Registering coordinators

These helpers let you keep registration as concise as any other `AddX` call in ASP.NET Core. Use the shorter
`AddCoordinator`/`AddScopedCoordinator`/`AddKeyedCoordinator` wrappers for readability, then pair them with
`AddEphemeralSignalJobRunner` when you also need attribute-driven jobs.

```csharp
var builder = WebApplication.CreateBuilder(args);

builder.Services.AddCoordinator<WorkItem>(
    async (item, ct) => await ProcessAsync(item, ct),
    new EphemeralOptions { MaxConcurrency = 8 });

builder.Services.AddEphemeralSignalJobRunner<LogWatcherJobs>();
```

The runner registers its own `SignalSink` so the builder-owned sink is shared between coordinators, log hooks, and the
`ResponsibilitySignalManager` wiring.

The library exposes extension methods on `IServiceCollection` to register coordinators in DI so they can be injected and
managed by the container.

-
`services.AddEphemeralWorkCoordinator<T>(Func<IServiceProvider, Func<T, CancellationToken, Task>> bodyFactory, EphemeralOptions? options = null)`
    - Registers a singleton `EphemeralWorkCoordinator<T>` created by the provided factory.

- `services.AddEphemeralWorkCoordinator<T>(Func<T, CancellationToken, Task> body, EphemeralOptions? options = null)`
    - Overload for simple delegates that don't need services from the container.

-
`services.AddEphemeralKeyedWorkCoordinator<T, TKey>(Func<T, TKey> keySelector, Func<IServiceProvider, Func<T, CancellationToken, Task>> bodyFactory, EphemeralOptions? options = null)`
    - Registers a keyed coordinator as a singleton.

-
`services.AddScopedEphemeralWorkCoordinator<T>(Func<IServiceProvider, Func<T, CancellationToken, Task>> bodyFactory, EphemeralOptions? options = null)`
    - Registers a scoped coordinator instance per scope (useful when the coordinator must resolve scoped dependencies
      during execution).

- Named coordinator builders
    -
    `services.AddEphemeralWorkCoordinator<T>(string name, Func<IServiceProvider, Func<T, CancellationToken, Task>> bodyFactory, EphemeralOptions? options = null)`
    - When using named coordinators, the extensions create and store a
      `ConcurrentDictionary<string, EphemeralCoordinatorConfiguration<T>>` in DI, and register an
      `IEphemeralCoordinatorFactory<T>` singleton that can create coordinators at runtime via `CreateCoordinator(name)`.

For a more idiomatic `IServiceCollection` surface you can also use the shorter helpers:

- `services.AddCoordinator<T>(Func<T, CancellationToken, Task> body, EphemeralOptions? options = null)` – a familiar
  `AddX` wrapper for `AddEphemeralWorkCoordinator`.
-
`services.AddCoordinator<T>(Func<IServiceProvider, Func<T, CancellationToken, Task>> bodyFactory, EphemeralOptions? options = null)` –
factory-aware overload.
-
`services.AddScopedCoordinator<T>(Func<IServiceProvider, Func<T, CancellationToken, Task>> bodyFactory, EphemeralOptions? options = null)` –
scoped lifetime variant.
-
`services.AddKeyedCoordinator<T, TKey>(Func<T, TKey> keySelector, Func<T, CancellationToken, Task> body, EphemeralOptions? options = null)`
and
`services.AddKeyedCoordinator<T, TKey>(Func<T, TKey> keySelector, Func<IServiceProvider, Func<T, CancellationToken, Task>> bodyFactory, EphemeralOptions? options = null)` –
keyed aliases.
-
`services.AddScopedKeyedCoordinator<T, TKey>(Func<T, TKey> keySelector, Func<IServiceProvider, Func<T, CancellationToken, Task>> bodyFactory, EphemeralOptions? options = null)` –
scoped keyed coordinator.

These helpers simply delegate to the `Ephemeral`-prefixed methods but make the registration/readability mirror other
ASP.NET Core services.

## Lane-aware coordinators

Priority-aware coordinators extend the same `AddCoordinator` idea with named lanes (`PriorityLane`) and optional signal
gates on each lane. Register `PriorityWorkCoordinator` or `PriorityKeyedWorkCoordinator` as a singleton whenever you
need hot/cold separation while keeping per-key ordering.

```csharp
var sink = new SignalSink();
var lanes = new[]
{
    new PriorityLane("hot:4", CancelOnSignals: new HashSet<string> { "maintenance" }),
    new PriorityLane("normal"),
    new PriorityLane("slow:2")
};

services.AddSingleton(_ => new PriorityWorkCoordinator<WorkItem>(
    new PriorityWorkCoordinatorOptions<WorkItem>(
        async (item, ct) => await itemProcessor.ProcessAsync(item, ct),
        lanes,
        new EphemeralOptions { Signals = sink })));
```

Keys are still handled with the keyed helpers—`PriorityKeyedWorkCoordinator` simply adds your key selector so each
partition remains sequential while the lane pump still favors the hot bowl.

Use the `AddCoordinator` family whenever you want the familiar `AddX` naming, including `services.AddScopedCoordinator`
and the keyed variants, so coordinators can be registered just like any other service at the lifetime you need.

## Registering attribute-driven runners

`mostlylucid.ephemeral.attributes` provides helper extensions:

-
`services.AddEphemeralSignalJobRunner<TJob>(EphemeralOptions? options = null, Func<IServiceProvider, SignalSink>? signalFactory = null)`
    - Registers a `SignalSink` (unless you provide one) and an `EphemeralSignalJobRunner` that instantiates the provided
      job types once and manages them as singletons.

-
`services.AddEphemeralScopedJobRunner<TJob>(EphemeralOptions? options = null, Func<IServiceProvider, SignalSink>? signalFactory = null)`
    - Registers a scoped runner that resolves job types per invocation (for jobs depending on scoped services).

Example:

```csharp
// Program.cs
var services = new ServiceCollection();

services.AddSingleton<OrderService>();

services.AddEphemeralWorkCoordinator<Order>(
    async (order, ct) => await services.GetRequiredService<OrderService>().ProcessAsync(order, ct),
    new EphemeralOptions { MaxConcurrency = 8 });

services.AddSingleton<InvoiceJobs>();
services.AddEphemeralSignalJobRunner<InvoiceJobs>();

var provider = services.BuildServiceProvider();

var factory = provider.GetRequiredService<IEphemeralCoordinatorFactory<Order>>();
var coordinator = factory.CreateCoordinator();
await coordinator.EnqueueAsync(new Order());
```

## Notes and best practices

- Lifetime mismatch: avoid singletons capturing scoped services (inject IServiceProvider and resolve scoped services
  inside factory lambdas when needed).
- Disposal: singleton coordinator factories implement IDisposable and cancel created coordinators on dispose; ensure
  `IServiceProvider` is disposed when appropriate (e.g., by using a root `ServiceProvider` in a host).
- Named coordinators are useful when you need multiple configurations ("priority", "background", etc.) and want shared
  factories for runtime creation.

## Troubleshooting

- If `CreateCoordinator` throws `InvalidOperationException` for a name, ensure
  `AddEphemeralWorkCoordinator<T>(name, ...)` was called during registration for that name.
- If resolution fails at runtime, check that required packages and types are registered (e.g., `SignalSink` or job
  types).
